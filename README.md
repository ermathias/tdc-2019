API Composition - A Microservices Pattern

Microservices patterns from Chris Richardson's Microservices Patterns https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-patterns

Once you apply the Database Per Service pattern, you may face a challenge to "join" data from different databases.

The API Composition pattern addresses this by combining 2 (or more) services by joining their APIs.

In this example, I have implemented the pattern using Spring Webflux.
